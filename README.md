# Trademark_Distinctiveness
Aim is to create a model which can classify trademark using The Abercrombie Spectrum

Many of these small to medium businesses find it very hard to invest time and money in choosing and protecting the trademark. Questions such as whether a brand is worth protecting or needs to be rebranded would need to be asked before applying. A distinctiveness score using “The Abercrombie Spectrum” (originated from a US case) is widely used, which would help in trademark registration in different parts of the world.
